# wireframing
Wireframing is an important part of the design process being a blueprint or a structural outline of an application or a web site. It describes the general framework and design without going into finer details such as the colour, fonts or pictures. Wireframes are used to emphasize the positioning of certain elements, navigation, and the structure of the general user interface.

Importance:
-Clarifies Ideas and Concepts
-Facilitates Communication
-Identifies Usability Issues
-Saves Time and Resources
-Provides a Clear Layout and Structure
-Enables Easy Modifications
-Guides the Design Process
-Focuses on Functionality and User Experience

# Types of Wireframes
Low-fidelity wireframes are basic rudimentary drawings with a focus on structure, layout, and functionality that do not include detailed images. High-fidelity wireframes are, conversely, more refined, including design features such as colors, typography, spacing, and are similar to the final product and are used to perform advanced usability testing and presentations to stakeholders.

# Type of fidelity explanations
In the link of the prototype the fidelity is a high-fidelity wireframe as it entails coloors, buttons and a clear stractural layout

# Popular Wireframing Tools
Some of the tools make the process of wireframing less complex with their user-friendly interface and collaboration capabilities. The most popular ones are Figma, Adobe XD, Balsamiq, and Sketch.

Key Features:

-Drag-and-drop design features.
-Collaboration and commenting in real-time.
-Ready-made elements of UI and templates.
-Simple exportation and assimilation with design processes.

# Advantages of Wireframing in Software Development.
Wireframing is very relevant to software development as it helps to balance the design concepts and technical realization and teamwork.

Key Benefits:

-Leads the Process of Design: This gives a clear direction to the developers and designers to adhere to.
-Paves the Way to Communication: Provides mutual understanding between the team and stakeholders.
-Exposes Usability Problems at an Early Stage: Points out navigation and interaction problems prior to coding.
-Conserves Time and Resources: helps to avoid expensive design changes in the development.

# Real-World Case Study: Wireframing Problematic Usability.
-This was during a wireframing stage of an e-commerce application whereby the users found it difficult to find a checkout button because it was not properly positioned.
Navigating it was also made easier because designers redesigned it to be more visible, which increased its conversion rates.

-Conclusion: Wireframing allowed identifying the issues with usability at an early stage, making the process effective in relation to the fixes that allowed achieving a more user-friendly and efficient design and providing the user with a better experience overall.
